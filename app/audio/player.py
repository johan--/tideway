"""PCMPlayer — PyAV + sounddevice audio engine.

Decodes DASH / local audio with PyAV and drives a sounddevice
OutputStream at the track's native sample rate + native format.
No software resampling or format conversion anywhere in the
playback path; samples hit CoreAudio / WASAPI / ALSA bit-identical
to what's in the source.

Gapless transitions: preloaded next-track PCM is spliced into the
live OutputStream at the sample boundary (same-rate) or triggers a
~50ms stream reopen (cross-rate). Both paths sit behind `preload()`
and fire automatically on natural end-of-track.

Threading model:
  - Main thread (HTTP handlers): calls load/play/pause/resume/seek/
    stop/set_volume/set_muted. Mutates state through a lock; never
    blocks on the audio pipeline.
  - Decoder thread: pulls PCM chunks from `Decoder`, pushes into
    `_pcm_queue`. Exits at EOF or when `_stop_flag` is set. Seek
    is applied in-flight: `seek()` calls `Decoder.request_seek()`
    + drains the queue, and the decoder picks up the seek on its
    next iteration.
  - Audio callback (sounddevice realtime thread): drains the queue,
    fills output buffers. Honours the `_paused` flag (outputs
    silence, doesn't drain) and applies volume/mute.

        prefetch fans out via a ThreadPoolExecutor: without jitter, all

        each one then issues two parallel Tidal API calls (track

        through the same `_resolve_source` path so it benefits from

        wrapper since there's only one foreground request at a time.

             selection is preserved AND PortAudio's enumeration
             gets refreshed in the same step so the picker shows
             the new device next time it opens.

        Standard streaming-app behavior: unplug headphones, audio
        keeps playing on speakers; plug them back in, the picker
        sees them again. ~50 ms of silence while CoreAudio
        renegotiates, same as a manual device switch.

        The decoder thread keeps feeding the PCM queue throughout,
        so once we open a fresh stream the first callback drains
        the queued frames and audio resumes seamlessly.

        Single source of truth for the field copies that drive a

        (_try_gapless_swap, _bridge_to_preload, _adopt_preload_locked)
        and inevitably drifted — the cross-rate gapless bug we just
        shipped a fix for came from one of those copies forgetting a
        partner emit. Centralising it here means a new field on
        `_Preload` only has to be wired up once.

        Atomicity: each assignment is one bytecode op under the GIL,
        but the *sequence* is not atomic, and the audio callback is
        lock-free — holding `_lock` (as `_adopt_preload_locked` does)
        does NOT keep the callback out, so it could read a
        half-swapped pipeline: the new track's queue with the old
        track's ReplayGain and filter state. That mismatch is the
        split-second "explosion" on track change. The `_swapping`
        guard below closes it: it's set before the first ref changes
        and cleared after the ReplayGain re-derive, and the callback
        emits silence the whole time (sub-millisecond, inaudible).
        `_try_gapless_swap` runs in the callback thread itself, so
        the guard there is just set and cleared within one
        invocation — harmless, and keeps a single code path.

        Always copies the rate / dtype / channels triple along with
        the rest. Same-rate swaps no-op those (the values match the
        active stream); the alternative — conditional copies — was
        the contract drift this helper exists to prevent.

    tracks get the same loudness-leveling treatment as streamed ones.

    Standard tag names per format:
      - FLAC / Vorbis: REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN, REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK,
        REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN, REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK (uppercase).
      - MP3 (ID3): TXXX:replaygain_track_gain etc. (case-insensitive).
      - MP4 (iTunes-style): ----:com.apple.iTunes:replaygain_track_gain.

    Mutagen normalises tag access enough that a flat dict-style lookup
    covers FLAC + Vorbis + MP4 in one path. ID3 needs explicit TXXX
    frame iteration. Anything we can't parse falls through to an
    all-None tags object — the resolver treats that as "no data" and
    skips the gain stage for the track, matching streaming behaviour.
